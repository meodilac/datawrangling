Q5. TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR: Based on your exploration of the tables in the course dataset. Why are the results to this specific query empty?
 SELECT *
 FROM
     dsv1069.users
 JOIN
     dsv1069.events
 ON
     users.parent_user_id = events.user_id
 WHERE
     event_name = 'view_item'
 AND
     merged_at is NULL
     
  1. The users table is empty
  2. There are no events with this event_name
  3. There are no parent_user_ids that satisfy the WHERE clause
 Answer:  3. There are no parent_user_ids that satisfy the WHERE clause.
 
Q6. TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR: Why are the results for this specific query empty?

 FROM
     dsv1069.events
 WHERE
     event_name = 'item_view'
     
  1. There are no events with this event_name
  2. The table is empty
  3. No items have ever been viewed
 Answer:  1. There are no events with this event_name
 
Q7. What does this query do? Select all true statements.
 SELECT
     COUNT(*)
 FROM
     dsv1069.events
 WHERE
     event_name = 'view_item'
     
  1. The query counts the number of rows in the events table.
  2. The query counts the number of events. 
  3. The query returns all of the rows in the events table.
  4. The query counts the number of view_item events.
  5. The query counts the number of rows corresponding to view_item events.

Q8. Consider the following query: What happens when some rows have a NULL value in the column table_alpha.key?
 SELECT *
 FROM table_alpha
 JOIN table_beta
 ON table_alpha.key = table_beta.column
 
  1. Each row with a null value is joined to every row in table_beta where table_beta.column is null.
  2. Those values aren’t included in the result.
  3. Each row with a null value will be joined to every row in table_beta.
  4. It is not possible for a join key to be null, the query will return an error.
 Answer:  1. Each row with a null value is joined to every row in table_beta where table_beta.column is null.
 
Q9. Which of the following are problems with the query below?
 SELECT
     COUNT(*)
 FROM
     dsv1069.users
 JOIN
     dsv1069.orders
 ON
     users.parent_user_id = orders.user_id

  1. Count(*) counts rows not unique users
  2. We need a GROUP BY clause
  3. We are missing a comma
  4. The join should be on users.parent_user_id
  5. There are no error messages, so it must be right
  6. The join should be on users.user_id
 Answer:  1. Count(*) counts rows not unique users
 
Q10. In the users table, the column parent_user_id is?
  1. Always NULL
  2. Never NULL
  3. Sometimes NULL
 Answer:  3. Sometimes NULL
